# Incentives

The goal of this project is to build a system to **incentivize**, **recognize** and **reward** contributions to **Digital Public Goods** (DPGs), defined as open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable best practices, do no harm and are of high relevance for attainment of the [UN’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html) (SDGs). 

This project is one of the workstreams of the [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/), and is led by the [UNICEF Office of Innovation](https://www.unicef.org/innovation/). One of the primary objectives of this project is to be designed, developed and implemented in an open, transparent and collaborative way involving the broad open source community.
